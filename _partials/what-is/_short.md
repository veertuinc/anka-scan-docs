# About
The Veertu Anka Scanner software solution scans for vulnerabilities in Anka images used for CI building and testing of iOS or macOS applications. Using an NVD database to generate a report, the scanner identifies vulnerabilities in Brew, Golang, Javascript, Java, Ruby, Python, and Rust. It does not require installation inside of the Anka VM/image or host.

We are also working to increase the scope of the Veertu Anka Scanner to also scan and report vulnerabilities in AWS EC2 macOS AMIs and not just Anka images.

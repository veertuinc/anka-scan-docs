# About

The Veertu Scanner software solution scans for vulnerabilities in Anka images and macOS filesystems used for CI building and testing of iOS or macOS applications. The scanner identifies vulnerabilities in libraries and tools utilizing an NVD database and provides a report. It does not require installation inside of the Anka VM/image or host.

We are also working to increase the scope of the Veertu Scanner to also scan and report vulnerabilities in AWS EC2 macOS AMIs and not just Anka images.

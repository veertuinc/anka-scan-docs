# About Anka Scan

The Veertu Anka Scan software solution scans for vulnerabilities in Anka VM templates/tags that are used for CI/CD building and testing of iOS or macOS applications. Using an NVD database to target and report, the scanner identifies vulnerabilities in Brew, Golang, Javascript, Java, Ruby, Python, and Rust. It does not require installation inside of the Anka VM or host.

We are also working to increase the scope of the Veertu Anka Scan to also scan and report vulnerabilities in AWS EC2 macOS AMIs and not just Anka images.
